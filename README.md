This was an interview I really messed up. I think it was nerves for me. Very simple project of recreating a portion of the website. However, I recreated the interview question here to show that I have the skills needed to complete the project.

I appreciate the opportunity to interview. A couple things that I need to work on:

<li>my nerves</li>
<li>always practice</li>
<li>trust in myself to complete these tasks</li>

I appreciate the opportunity to interview. I know starting at my blank screen in not very exciting but if anyone from Dish is reading this (unlikely), I have the skills to do these tasks.
